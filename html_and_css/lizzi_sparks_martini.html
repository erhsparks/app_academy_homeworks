    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Classic martini. Stirred, not shaken, because the grad student in me doesn't want to have to wash more dishes than necessary. I'm pretty sure James Bond has a guy for that.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>One martini glass, or a tumbler if you're accident-prone</li>
      <li>Vodka or Gin, whatever your pleasure</li>
      <li>Vermouth, a splash at most</li>
      <li>If vodka: (at least) three olives and a liberal pour of olive juice</li>
      <li>If gin: twist of lemon</li>
    </ul>

    <a name="directions"/>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>If going the vodka and olives route: put olives in glass and pour in about enough olive juice to cover them. Else skip.</li>
      <li>Fill glass about 3/4 with vodka/gin. This is pretty much your only ingredient and there is no point in measuring it.</li>
      <li>Pour in a splash of vermouth. A splash! Stop! You've already added too much! That's why we only went 3/4 full in step 2 -- to correct the inevitable vermouth error.</li>
      <li>Correct vermouth error to taste with more vodka/gin.</li>
      <li>Add your twist of lemon if you're into that kind of thing. Else more olive juice, you can never have enough.</li>
      <li>Na zdorovie!</li>
    </ol>
